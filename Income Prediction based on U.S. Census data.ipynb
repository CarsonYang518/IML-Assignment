You can use any Python built-in packages, but do not use any other 3rd party packages (the packages listed above are all fine to use); if your iPython notebook doesn't run on the marker's machine, you will lose marks. <b> You should use Python 3</b>.  \n",

    "(a) The NB classifiers for 1-hot encoded (binary) categorical attributes performs best, because it has the highest Macro F1-score, which gives a better measure of the incorrectly classified cases than the accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "(b) Accuracy is usually larger than F1-score, because accuracy only cares about correct predictions, but F1-score also cares about incorrect classifications. Because F1-score is the harmonic mean of Precision and Recall, Precision shows how precise the model is out of those predicted positive, Recall calculates the percentage of actual positives the model correctly classified.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "(c) No, I can't. Because in this case, the bank manager wants to avoid falsely granting a loan to an applicant with insufficient income, the FP (classify people with \"<=50K\" into \">50K\") should be low, in a result, Precision should be the evaluation metric, $ Precision = \\frac{TP}{TP+FP} $, the lower the FP is, the higer the Precision is.\n",
